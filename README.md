# Urban Traffic Optimization for SDG 11

## 🌍 AI for Sustainable Cities and Communities

![SDG 11](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=SDG+11+Sustainable+Cities+and+Communities)

## Project Overview

This machine learning project addresses **UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** by optimizing urban traffic flow and public transportation systems using AI.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion causes:
- **Economic losses**: $87 billion annually in wasted fuel and time
- **Environmental impact**: 30% of urban CO2 emissions from transportation
- **Social inequality**: Limited mobility access for vulnerable populations

### 🤖 ML Solution Approach

1. **Unsupervised Learning**: K-means clustering to identify traffic patterns
2. **Supervised Learning**: Random Forest to predict congestion levels
3. **Route Optimization**: Data-driven public transport efficiency analysis

### 📊 Key Features

- Traffic pattern analysis and clustering
- Congestion prediction model
- Public transport route optimization
- Interactive visualization dashboard
- Sustainability impact assessment
